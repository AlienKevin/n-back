# n-back
The n-back is a continuous performance task for improving working memory.

# How it works
You are shown a sequence of letters and need to remember if the current letter matches n letter before. The most common n is 2.

e.g. 2-back

B D **C** B **C**

The current **C** matches 2 letters before.

# Stimuli
The letters were presented for 500 ms followed by a 2000-ms inter-stimulus interval during which the letter was replaced by a blank screen. In all conditions, 33% of letters were targets. Letters were randomly selected from English consonants. Vowels were excluded to reduce the likeliness of participants developing chunking strategies which reduce mental effort.
